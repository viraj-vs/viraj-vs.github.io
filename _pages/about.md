AI education is not accessible at the high school level. To fill this gap Maya, Shyam, Sofia and myself under the guidance of Mrs Graciela Elia as an advisor, created the Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Club at Princeton High School(PHS), Princeton, NJ. I am the Founder & President of this AI & ML Club at Princeton High School (PHS), Princeton, NJ.
